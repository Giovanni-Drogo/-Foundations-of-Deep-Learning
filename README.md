# -Foundations-of-Deep-Learning
This assignment involves the debugging and application of classic convolutional neural networks, specifically AlexNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet. 

You can observe corresponding changes in the models by modifying the number of training epochs and the learning rate, including training time and accuracy, among other factors. 

I have also included relevant charts in my report for your reference.
