# -Foundations-of-Deep-Learning
My personal lab and project implementations for the "Fundations of Deep Learning" course taught by Professor Sun Xiaoguang at Fudan University, Spring 2025.

You can change the branch to the homework including lab reports and codes in juypter or python format.

What's more, I also upload the PPTs which Professor Sun used to presentions his points succinctly and cleraly.
