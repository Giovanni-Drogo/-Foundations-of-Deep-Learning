This assignment involves the practical application of CNNs such as YOLO and ResNet in the field of computer vision. Using an image as an example, it covers image augmentation, semantic segmentation, and style transfer. Pre-training was conducted using the small dataset "sports," and the results were compared with those of a model without pre-training. Relevant results and resources have been listed in detail.
