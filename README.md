This is a relevant lab and experimentation involving recurrent neural networks such as RNN and LSTM. By adjusting parameters related to RNN and LSTM, such as the number of layers, activation functions, and the number of LSTM layers, the experiments observe and compare different results on the same dataset—specifically, a weather dataset. The lab report provides a more detailed explanation.
